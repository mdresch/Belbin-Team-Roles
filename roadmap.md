Project Goal (Assumed): To accurately and efficiently classify text contributions (e.g., meeting sentences, chat messages) according to Belbin Team Roles using a combination of cloud and/or local LLMs, and potentially integrate this capability into a larger process or tool.

Phase 1: Foundation & Evaluation (Current Stage - Weeks 1-3)
Phase 1: Foundation & Evaluation (Belbin Roles - Module A)

Goal: Establish a working baseline, evaluate initial performance, and identify key challenges.

Tasks:

[DONE] Setup basic Python environment (main.py, utils.py, config.py, prompts.py).

[DONE] Integrate Gemini API for initial category classification.

[DONE] Integrate local LLM (Ollama + model like Deepseek Coder) via OpenAI-compatible API for role classification and fallback.

[DONE] Implement error handling for API calls (Gemini & Local), JSON parsing, safety blocks.

[DONE] Create initial test dataset (sentences.csv) with expected categories and roles.

[IN PROGRESS/DONE] Run initial batch processing using the hybrid approach (main.py).

* Deliverable: Stable baseline script for Belbin Role classification, initial performance report.
* 

Analyze Initial Results:

Calculate preliminary accuracy for Category (Gemini).

Calculate preliminary accuracy for Role (Local LLM, given the category).

Identify patterns in misclassifications (specific roles, specific sentence types, category vs. role errors).

Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the fallback mechanism.

Document Findings: Summarize initial performance, key error sources (e.g., Gemini category errors, local model bias), and technical challenges encountered.

Deliverable: Working baseline script, initial performance report & analysis document.

Phase 2: Model & Prompt Refinement (Weeks 4-8)
Phase 2: Model & Prompt Refinement (Belbin Roles - Module A) 

Goal: Improve the accuracy of both category and role classification based on initial findings.

Tasks:

Prompt Engineering (Category - Gemini):

Analyze sentences where Gemini misclassified the category (Action/People/Thought).

Refine FIRST_LEVEL_PROMPT with clearer definitions, better keywords, negative constraints, or potentially few-shot examples to improve category accuracy.

Test refined prompt iteratively on problematic sentences and a validation subset.

Prompt Engineering (Role - Local LLM):

Analyze sentences where the local model misclassified the role even when the category was correct (e.g., Teamworker vs. Co-ordinator).

Refine BELBIN_ROLE_PROMPTS (especially for "People") to create clearer distinctions for the local model.

Analyze and refine the SYNONYM_PROMPT based on fallback performance (e.g., sentence 44). Consider adding more context if needed.

Test refined prompts iteratively.

Model Exploration (Optional but Recommended):

Test alternative local models (e.g., Mistral, Llama3 variants available via Ollama) for the role classification step. Compare accuracy and speed.

Experiment with using a local model for the category classification step. Compare its accuracy vs. Gemini's.

Consider different Gemini models (e.g., Pro vs. Flash) if cost/performance trade-offs are relevant.

Re-evaluate Performance: Run the full dataset (or a larger validation set) with the refined prompts/models. Measure improved accuracy.

Deliverable: Updated prompts, potentially alternative model recommendations, improved accuracy metrics, updated performance report.

* Deliverable: Refined prompts/models for Belbin Roles, improved accuracy report.

Phase 2.5: Sentiment Analysis Development (Module B - Parallel/Independent)

Goal: Develop and evaluate functions for both general sentence sentiment and Belbin-specific sentiment.

Approach: Create new, separate files for this functionality to avoid disrupting the working Belbin code.

Tasks:

Setup New Files:

Create sentiment_utils.py (or similar): This will house the functions specifically for sentiment analysis.

Create sentiment_config.py (Optional, or add to main config.py): Store sentiment-specific settings (e.g., model names, thresholds).

Create test_sentiment.py (or similar): A script dedicated only to testing the sentiment functions, separate from main.py.

General Sentiment:

In sentiment_utils.py, implement/refine the get_sentiment_with_pretrained function (using Hugging Face sentiment-analysis pipeline, as was present in your original utils.py). Ensure it returns consistent output (e.g., 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral', score).

Add thresholding for 'neutral' if desired.

In test_sentiment.py, write tests calling get_sentiment_with_pretrained with various sentences and verifying the output.

Belbin-Specific Sentiment (Requires Fine-Tuned Model):

Data Preparation: This is a significant sub-task. You need training/validation data where sentences are labeled with both the Belbin Role and a corresponding sentiment (positive/negative/neutral contribution in the context of that role). This might look like Implementer_positive, Shaper_negative, etc.

Fine-Tuning (Separate Process): Develop or use a separate script (fine_tune_belbin_sentiment.py?) to fine-tune a transformer model (like distilbert-base-uncased mentioned in your original config.py) on this combined Role+Sentiment label data. This process saves the fine-tuned model files (including label_map.json). This fine-tuning step is independent of the main classification script.

Implementation in sentiment_utils.py:

Implement/refine load_fine_tuned_model (loading tokenizer, model, and label_map.json from the fine-tuning output path).

Implement/refine get_belbin_sentiment to use the loaded fine-tuned model, predict the combined label (e.g., Implementer_positive), and then split it into belbin_role and belbin_sentiment outputs, potentially adding a confidence score.

Testing in test_sentiment.py: Add tests calling get_belbin_sentiment and verifying its output format and reasonableness (exact accuracy depends heavily on the fine-tuning quality).

Deliverable:

sentiment_utils.py with working sentiment functions.

test_sentiment.py for validating sentiment functions.

(If pursued) Fine-tuned model artifacts for Belbin sentiment.

Report on sentiment model performance/evaluation.

Phase 3: Application & Integration Design (Parallel to Phase 2 or Weeks 9-10)
Phase 3: Integration Design

Goal: Define how the classification capability will be used in practice.
Goal: Plan how to combine Belbin Roles (Module A) and Sentiment (Module B).

Tasks:

Define Use Case(s): How will this be used?

Analyzing historical meeting transcripts?

Real-time feedback during meetings?

Analyzing chat logs?

Generating team role reports?

Define Combined Output: Decide the final desired output format. Should the CSV (or API response) have separate columns for:

Predicted Belbin Role (from Module A)

Predicted General Sentiment (from Module B)

Predicted Belbin Role according to the sentiment model (from Module B - get_belbin_sentiment)

Predicted Belbin Sentiment (from Module B - get_belbin_sentiment)

Define Workflow: How should the modules interact?

Option 1 (Sequential): Run Module A (Belbin Roles) first, then run Module B (Sentiment) on the same sentence. Combine results. (Simplest integration).

Option 2 (Conditional): Maybe only run detailed Belbin sentiment if the general sentiment is strongly positive/negative?

Option 3 (Consolidated?): Could the fine-tuned Belbin sentiment model replace the separate Belbin role classification if its role prediction is accurate enough? (Evaluate this based on Phase 2.5 results).

Update Architecture: Modify the technical architecture design from the original Phase 3 to incorporate the chosen workflow and sentiment_utils.py.

Update main.py Plan: Outline the changes needed in main.py (or a new coordinating script) to call both modules and combine results.

Deliverable: Updated architecture design, defined combined output format, planned integration workflow.

Integration into an existing HR or project management tool?

Input Mechanism: How will text get into the system (file upload, API endpoint, manual entry, copy-paste)?

Output/Reporting: What should the output look like? Simple classification? Aggregated scores per person/meeting? Visualizations (radar charts)? Confidence scores?

User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Sketch: If it's an interactive tool, design basic wireframes or mockups.

Technical Architecture: Design how the Python backend interacts with the input/output mechanisms (e.g., simple script, Flask/FastAPI web service, integration module).

Deliverable: Use case document, basic UI/UX mockups (if applicable), technical architecture design.

Phase 4: Prototype Development (Weeks 11-14)

Goal: Build a functional prototype based on the chosen use case and refined model/prompts.

Tasks:

Develop the input mechanism (e.g., simple web form, file processor).

Integrate the core classification logic (analyze_contribution function) into the application structure.

Develop the output/reporting mechanism (e.g., display results on a web page, generate a basic report file).

Implement basic error handling and user feedback within the prototype.

Refactor core logic for better structure and potential reuse (if moving beyond a simple script).

Deliverable: Working prototype demonstrating the core use case.

Phase 4: Integration & Prototype Update

Goal: Integrate the validated sentiment functions into the main workflow/prototype.

Tasks:

Refactor main.py (or create app.py):

Import functions from both utils.py (Belbin Roles) and sentiment_utils.py.

Modify the main processing loop (analyze_contribution or equivalent) to call the necessary functions from both modules according to the chosen workflow (e.g., call analyze_contribution for role, call get_general_sentiment, call get_belbin_sentiment).

Combine the results into the desired output structure (e.g., updated dictionary for the CSV row).

Update Output: Modify the CSV writing (or API response generation) to include the new sentiment columns.

Update UI (If applicable): Add display elements for sentiment results in the prototype.

Deliverable: Updated prototype incorporating both Belbin Role and Sentiment analysis. Updated main.py or new application script.

Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Weeks 15-16)

Goal: Ensure the prototype works correctly and meets basic requirements.

Tasks:

Functional Testing: Test the prototype with various inputs (different sentences, file types if applicable).

Accuracy Validation (End-to-End): Test the prototype on a new set of unseen sentences. Compare against human judgment (ideally Belbin experts).

Usability Testing (If UI exists): Get feedback from potential users on ease of use and clarity of results.

Performance Testing (Basic): Assess response time for single inputs or small batches.

Deliverable: Test results summary, bug list, usability feedback.

Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Integrated)

Goal: Test the combined system.

Tasks:

Retest core Belbin Role functionality to ensure integration didn't break it (regression testing).

Test sentiment functionality within the integrated workflow.

Validate the combined output format.

Perform accuracy/usability/performance testing on the integrated prototype.

Deliverable: Integrated test results, updated bug list/feedback.

Phase 6: Deployment & Iteration (Integrated)
* (Tasks as previously defined, but now for the integrated application)



Phase 6: Deployment & Iteration (Ongoing)

Goal: Make the tool available for use and plan future improvements.

Tasks:

Deployment: Deploy the prototype/application to the target environment (e.g., internal server, cloud platform, local distribution).

Monitoring: Implement basic logging/monitoring to track usage, performance, and errors in production.

Gather Feedback: Collect ongoing feedback from users.

Maintenance: Regularly update dependencies, models (if needed), and address bugs.

Backlog Grooming: Prioritize future enhancements based on feedback and evolving goals (e.g., full transcript analysis, sentiment integration, advanced reporting, UI improvements, fine-tuning models).

Deliverable: Deployed application (v1), monitoring plan, feedback mechanism, prioritized backlog for v2.

Cross-Cutting Considerations:

Ethics & Bias: Be mindful of potential biases in LLMs and how classifications might be interpreted or misused, especially in HR contexts.

Data Privacy: Ensure handling of input text complies with privacy regulations.

Cost Management: Track API costs (Gemini) and compute costs (local LLM, hosting).

Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for code, prompts, and usage.

Version Control: Continue using Git rigorously.

This roadmap provides a structured path. You can adjust the timelines and specific tasks based on your priorities, resources, and the evolving performance of the models.
